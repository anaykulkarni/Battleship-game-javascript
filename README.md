# Battleship-game-javascript
Battleship is a single player board game where a user guesses the locations of the battleships which are hidden in the board.
The Battleship game is designed as an SPA (Single page application). The application is developed using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
The design was accomplished using MVC (Model View Controller). JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

The user inputs his/her guess and the appropriate result is produced on the screen with a message. Three such battleships - each occupying three consecutive locations are randomly placed on the board. The game ends when all the battleships are sunk.
